## Deja Cue

> What is `cue`?

`cue` is a pipeline that mines and ranks common sentences found in conversation. Rehearse the cues until you glitch the Matrix and respond in bullet time.

## Usage

> Is the mined dataset included in automated releases?

No. The mined dataset is committed to a separate repository: [`cue-data`](https://github.com/8ta4/cue-data)

Mining and deduplicating a large set of candidates is computationally intensive. I run the process manually, verify that the results look reasonable and commit only when I'm satisfied.
